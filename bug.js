This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in JavaScript, but can be particularly tricky to debug in React Native because the component rendering process can make it difficult to trace the source of the null or undefined value.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const user = useUser(); // useUser is a custom hook fetching user data
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    </View>
  );
};
```

This code will throw an error if `useUser()` hasn't yet fetched the user data or if it returns `null` or `undefined`.
